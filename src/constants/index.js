    üèÜ I am proud to announce that I secured the **3rd position** at the prestigious **e-Yantra Robotics Competition** (Swachhta Bot ü§ñ) organized by **IIT Bombay** üòä.
    
    üß† I spent countless hours coding, designing, and building robots ‚Äî and learned so much throughout the journey. The competition pushed me to think creatively, solve complex problems, and collaborate effectively with my teammate.
    
    üìå **Theme of the Competition**:
    We had to build a **line-following robot** that navigates through an arena ‚Äî an abstraction of a smart city. Each city block contained different types of garbage.
    
    The bot was designed to:
    - Sense and classify garbage
    - Travel to the correct dumping yard
    - Use **Dijkstra's Algorithm** to find the optimal path
    - Communicate with a laptop using **Zigbee** for real-time commands
    
    üõ† **Phases of the Competition**:
    1. **Simulation Phase**:
       - Designed the robot software using **Verilog**
       - Tested logic using simulation tools
       - Verified all functionalities virtually
    
    2. **Hardware Phase**:
       - Implemented the robot on an **FPGA board**
       - Debugged and optimized the robot for real-world scenarios
       - Performed rigorous hardware testing
    
    üéâ It was a fantastic accomplishment to be selected among the **top 4 teams** for the championship round at IIT Bombay. A truly unforgettable experience in innovation and teamwork!,
