      "I am proud to announce that I secured the 3rd position at the prestigious e-Yantra Robotics Competition (Swatchhta Bot ü§ñ ) organized by IITB üòä. I spent countless hours coding, designing, and building robots, and I learned so much in the process. The competition challenged me to think outside the box, solve problems, and collaborate effectively with my team member.The theme was to make line following bot which travels across the arena, which is abstraction of smart-city. City has different city-blocks with some kind of garbage. Bot is supposed to sense and classify the garbage and dump it in respective dumping yard out of city. The bot finds optimal path using dijkstra's algorithm and communicate with laptop using zigbee.ü§ñ There were two phases to the competition, first stage was simulation-based, where I had to design and implement our robot's software using Verilog and simulation tools. Once we were satisfied with our simulation results, and making sure it was functioning as intended, we moved on to the second stage, which was actual hardware-based. We had to implement our design on an FPGA board and test our robot's functionality in real-life scenarios. This involved debugging and optimizing our design to ensure that it could operate reliably in various scenarios. It was a fantastic accomplishment to be chosen as one of the top 4 teams for the championship game at IITB.",

      "In response to the persistent challenge of ensuring safety despite the use of security cameras, I am proud to present my groundbreaking innovation - the Smart Security Camera. This cutting-edge device aims to revolutionize security protocols by providing a real-time solution to detect and prevent robberies effectively. Unlike traditional security cameras that merely record footage, my Smart Security Camera is equipped with advanced capabilities that empower it to take proactive security actions.When the Smart Security Camera identifies a potential robbery in progress, it swiftly captures an image of the suspect and promptly sends it to the designated administrator's email. Additionally, the camera initiates a phone call to the administrator, alerting them to the situation at hand. The administrator, upon receiving the alerts, can simply reply to the email with a straightforward 'yes' or 'no' to confirm if the person captured is indeed a suspect.If the reply is 'no,' the system continues its smooth operation, ensuring there are no unnecessary disruptions for innocent individuals. However, if the reply is 'yes,' the Smart Security Camera goes into high-alert mode, activating a loud alarm to deter the robber and alert anyone nearby. Simultaneously, the camera shares the exact location of the strong room or vulnerable area with the nearest police station.The integration of innovative technology in security measures marks a significant step towards creating a safer environment for businesses and individuals alike. Together, let's embrace this transformative solution and put an end to robberies in real-time. üè¢üö®üí°",
