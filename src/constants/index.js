      "I am proud to announce that I secured the 3rd position at the prestigious e-Yantra Robotics Competition (Swatchhta Bot ü§ñ ) organized by IITB üòä. I spent countless hours coding, designing, and building robots, and I learned so much in the process. The competition challenged me to think outside the box, solve problems, and collaborate effectively with my team member.The theme was to make line following bot which travels across the arena, which is abstraction of smart-city. City has different city-blocks with some kind of garbage. Bot is supposed to sense and classify the garbage and dump it in respective dumping yard out of city. The bot finds optimal path using dijkstra's algorithm and communicate with laptop using zigbee.ü§ñ There were two phases to the competition, first stage was simulation-based, where I had to design and implement our robot's software using Verilog and simulation tools. Once we were satisfied with our simulation results, and making sure it was functioning as intended, we moved on to the second stage, which was actual hardware-based. We had to implement our design on an FPGA board and test our robot's functionality in real-life scenarios. This involved debugging and optimizing our design to ensure that it could operate reliably in various scenarios. It was a fantastic accomplishment to be chosen as one of the top 4 teams for the championship game at IITB.",

      "Introducing our revolutionary Smart Security Robot, a marvel of innovation and advanced technology crafted using Arduino, ultrasonic sensors, laser sensors, motor drivers, and PIR sensors. This cutting-edge bot is designed to navigate seamlessly through homes, avoiding collisions with obstacles, Upon sensing movement, a series of intricate actions come into play.Leveraging servo motors and an additional ultrasonic sensor, the Smart Security Robot accurately determines the position of the closest person within its 180-degree field of freedom. Instantaneously, the servo motor swings into action, orienting the robot towards the detected position. Armed with a laser sensor, the bot locks onto the identified suspect, enabling precise targeting. This sophisticated system ensures that the robot can effectively assess potential threats and focus its attention on the specific areas of concern.Its autonomous and agile movements, coupled with its ability to identify and track potential intruders, sets a new standard for home security. With this powerful and efficient technology, users can experience enhanced peace of mind, knowing that their homes are safeguarded by an unparalleled security solution. Embrace the future of home protection with our Smart Security Robot, where innovation meets vigilance in a seamless symphony of safety and reliability. üè†ü§ñüöÄ",

With over 18 million visually impaired people in India and 2.2 billion worldwide, many individuals face daily challenges due to their lack of vision. While restoring sight may not be possible, technology can bridge the gap and enhance their independence.The Third Eye uses Raspberry Pi, a webcam, and a battery as its hardware, along with Python, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and OpenCV for software processing. This device enables visually impaired users to hear descriptions of objects in front of them, providing real-time environmental awareness. Additionally, it features a voice assistant system, allowing users to interact with the stick for essential information like current time and location using GPS.This innovation aims to empower visually impaired individuals by giving them a new way to perceive their surroundings, promoting accessibility, independence, and equality.

      "In response to the persistent challenge of ensuring safety despite the use of security cameras, I am proud to present my groundbreaking innovation - the Smart Security Camera. This cutting-edge device aims to revolutionize security protocols by providing a real-time solution to detect and prevent robberies effectively. Unlike traditional security cameras that merely record footage, my Smart Security Camera is equipped with advanced capabilities that empower it to take proactive security actions.When the Smart Security Camera identifies a potential robbery in progress, it swiftly captures an image of the suspect and promptly sends it to the designated administrator's email. Additionally, the camera initiates a phone call to the administrator, alerting them to the situation at hand. The administrator, upon receiving the alerts, can simply reply to the email with a straightforward 'yes' or 'no' to confirm if the person captured is indeed a suspect.If the reply is 'no,' the system continues its smooth operation, ensuring there are no unnecessary disruptions for innocent individuals. However, if the reply is 'yes,' the Smart Security Camera goes into high-alert mode, activating a loud alarm to deter the robber and alert anyone nearby. Simultaneously, the camera shares the exact location of the strong room or vulnerable area with the nearest police station.The integration of innovative technology in security measures marks a significant step towards creating a safer environment for businesses and individuals alike. Together, let's embrace this transformative solution and put an end to robberies in real-time. üè¢üö®üí°",
